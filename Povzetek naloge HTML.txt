II. HTML and CSS
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Hypertext means "text with links in it." Any time you click on a word that brings you to a new webpage, you've clicked on hypertext!

A markup language is a programming language used to make text do more than just sit on a page: it can turn text into images, links, tables, lists, and much more. HTML is the markup language we'll be learning.

What makes webpages pretty? That's CSS—Cascading Style Sheets. Think of it like skin and makeup that covers the bones of HTML. We'll learn HTML first, then worry about CSS in later courses.

The first thing we should do is set up the skeleton of the page.

a. Always put <!DOCTYPE html> on the first line. This tells the browser what language it's reading (in this case, HTML).
b. Always put <html> on the next line. This starts the HTML document.
c. Always put </html> on the last line. This ends the HTML document.

III. Basic terminology
To learn more HTML, we should learn how to talk about HTML. Already you have seen we use <>s a lot.

Things inside <>s are called tags.
Tags nearly always come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
Example of opening tag: <html>
Example of closing tag: </html>
You can think of tags as being like parentheses: whenever you open one, you should close it. Tags also nest, so you should close them in the right order: the most recently opened tag should be the first one closed, like in the example below.

<first tag><second tag>Some text!</second tag></first tag>
The last exercise taught us how to set up our HTML file. Everything we do now will go between <html> and </html>.

IV. Make the head
Everything in our HTML file will go between the opening <html> and closing </html> tags.

There are always two parts to an HTML file: the head and the body. Let's start with the head.

The head contains information about your HTML file, like its title. The title is what we see in the browser's title bar or page tab. For example the title of this page is "HTML Basics | Codecademy".

Instructions
Let's add a head and a title to our webpage. If you get stuck at any point, click "Stuck? Get a hint!" below for an example.

Add an opening <head> tag and closing </head> tag.
Between the <head> tags, add in an opening <title> tag and closing </title> tag.
Between the <title> tags, write in a title for your page. For example, "My Webpage."
Press "Save & Submit Code" to continue

V. Paragraphs in the body
Great job! To review, an HTML file has both a head and a body. The head is where you put information about your HTML file, like its title.

The body is where you put your content, such as text, images, and links. The content in the body is what will be visible on the actual page.

The body goes inside the <html> tags, right after the <head> tags, like this:

<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
  </body>
</html>
Instructions
Underneath the closing </head> tag, put an opening <body> tag and a closing </body> tag, like in the example above.
Inside the body, create two paragraphs. Each paragraph starts with an opening <p> tag and ends with a closing </p> tag. We can write content in between the tags, like this:
<body>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
</body>
